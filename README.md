# Hi there, I'm Abhishek Singh! 👋

### **Cloud & AIOps Engineer | DevSecOps Specialist**
#### *Specializing in Self-Healing Infrastructure & Event-Driven Automation*

I am a **Cloud & AIOps Engineer** focused on building **autonomous, self-healing infrastructure**. By fusing **Cybersecurity principles** with **Data Science methodologies**, I architect cloud environments that don't just run—they adapt, defend, and repair themselves in real-time.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy: The "AIOps" Approach
I build resilient systems by applying distinct disciplines to every layer of the cloud stack:

* **Security as Code (The Shield):** Leveraging my **Cybersecurity** background to embed "Shift-Left" guardrails that block vulnerabilities before deployment.
* **Intelligent Observability (The Brain):** Applying **Data Science** to operations—replacing static alerts with **Anomaly Detection** models that understand system drift.
* **Event-Driven Remediation (The Hands):** Engineering **Serverless workflows** (Lambda/EventBridge) that automatically resolve incidents, reducing reliance on manual intervention.
